## Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Simulation using Arena
##This project features a detailed simulation model of a job-shop manufacturing system built with Rockwell Arena. The simulation addresses a classic scheduling problem involving multiple job types, each with a unique processing sequence and machining time across a shared set of resources.
###üìù Problem Statement
The system models a production unit where four distinct types of jobs arrive for processing. The jobs are: Bolt, Nut, Gear, and Plug. These jobs arrive with inter-arrival times of 1, 2, 2.5, and 1.5 minutes, respectively. Each job type follows a specific routing sequence through seven different processing stations.

Job Sequences & Machining Times
The detailed routing and the time (in minutes) required at each machine are outlined below:

##üéØ Project Objectives
The primary goals of this simulation study are:
Develop a Model: To accurately construct a simulation model of the described job-shop manufacturing system using Arena.
Simulate & Visualize: To run the simulation to observe the system's behavior, identify potential bottlenecks, and visualize the flow of jobs.
Measure Performance: To calculate and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as makespan and cycle time to evaluate system efficiency.

##üõ†Ô∏è Model Details & System Logic
Here is a breakdown of the components and logic used to build the Arena model:
System Requirements: Windows OS and Rockwell Arena simulation software.
Entities: Four distinct entities representing each job type (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4).
Resources: The machines required for processing, including:
Turning Machine
Grinding Machine
Milling Machine
Cutting Machine
Drilling Machine
Threading Machine
Finishing Machine


## Process Logic: The core action for all machining processes is Seize Delay Release, where a job seizes a machine, is delayed for the required processing time, and then releases the machine.
Queue Discipline: All queues operate on a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) basis.
Stations: The model is built using stations to represent the different machining locations:
Station T (Turning)
Station Th (Threading)
Station C (Cutting)
Station M (Milling)
Station D (Drilling)
Station F (Finishing)
Station E (Exit/Dispose)

### Arena Modules Used
The simulation model was constructed using the following standard Arena modules:
Create: To generate the arrival of the four job types.
Assign: To set attributes for each entity, such as job type and processing times.
Station: To define the different workstations in the system.
Process: To model the machining operations (Seize-Delay-Release).
Route: To direct entities between stations according to their unique job sequences.
Dispose: To remove completed jobs from the system.
Other supporting modules as necessary.

## üöÄ How to Run the Simulation
Ensure you have Rockwell Arena installed on a Windows operating system.
Clone this repository or download the .doe model file.
Open the file in Arena.
Run the simulation to observe the model and generate the results report.

###üìä Results & Analysis
After running the simulation, a comprehensive report will be generated by Arena. The key metrics to analyze from this report are the makespan (total time to complete all jobs) and the average cycle time for each job type. These results will provide insights into the system's throughput, efficiency, and resource utilization.
